# Databases

The artifact I selected for the databases prompt was the final project from my Introduction to Structured Database Environments course. The final project involved navigating an existing database, adding information, and generating outputs to demonstrate a thorough understanding of SQL and database structure. I included this project because it shows my knowledge of working with databases to navigate database structure, update information, and generate outputs of data combined from multiple tables in the database.

In the final project, all of the inputs were done manually. For this prompt I have gone back and shown how new data can be added from a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file rather than entering each line by hand. This option automates much of the process to bring in data. There are common tools which can perform this action, but it is also good to know how to import the data without tools.

While this was a successful implementation of the addition I wanted, I discovered that it is easy to run into errors when importing data this way. Moving forward I would add a step of bringing the data into a temporary table to make sure that it came in correctly and then updating the live table after.
