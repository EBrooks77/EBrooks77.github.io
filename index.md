# Self Assessment

This ePortfolio is the culmination of four years of studying computer science with Southern New Hampshire University. While this journey started with a personal interest in learning something I had never tried before, it has ended with discovering a passion for the field. My current capstone course has given me the opportunity to look back over the last four years and critically assess what I have learned, and it has been a lot. I have learned multiple programming languages, worked with multiple integrated development environments (IDEs), collaborated with classmates to write programs, learned the software development lifecycle, worked with databases and big data, and delved into game programming.

### Programming Languages
Having never worked with programming in the past I was able to learn the basics of multiple programming languages throughout this program. This was done through learning the very basics of each programming language as a language, and then using them to work on programs or databases to increase my understanding. This has been a wonderful first step which will allow me to continue learning more about each language and increase what I can do with each over time. Once you understand the basics of a language, there is no limit to where it can take you. Some of the programming languages I was able to learn are:

-	Python
-	Java
-	C++
-	SQL

### Integrated DevelopmentEnvironments
As part of the process of learning both programming and the languages used to program, I had the opportunity to work with several different IDEs. With each one being a little different it gave me the opportunity to better understand how each IDE functioned, and what tools were available. While using Eclipse IDE I also had the opportunity to collaborate with classmates on joint software by pushing our individual programming tasks to a cloud repository and managing the combined workflow in the cloud. A few of the IDEs I have become familiar with are:

-	NetBeans
-	Eclipse
-	Visual Studio

### Development Lifecycle
Throughout the course of my degree, I was able to learn not just about programming and software development, but also what the software development lifecycle looks like. This mainly focused on learning the Agile method of project management, and how all the different stages of software development interact. Since learning Agile I have been able to take that knowledge into my current work role to create development goals for myself and a teammate to address inadequacies in our department’s knowledge base system and find new solutions to better leverage the department’s combined knowledge.

### Big Data and Databases
The greatest passion I have found in the many aspects of computer science during my studies have been in databases and big data. I have had the opportunity to work with data-mining software and focus on obtaining relevant data from batches of big data. I personally love finding trends on large amounts of information and was able to take that a step further by using the software to focus on classification, clustering, and sequential pattern discovery. I also had the opportunity to learn about the creation, maintenance, and changing of databases to house this and other data. 




# ePortfolio Content

This portfolio takes a sampling of the different projects that I have worked on and updates them to improve either their function or efficiency. The three categories of computer science artifacts to be used were software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. For the software design and engineering category I selected a slideshow program I had created in a past course. The idea was to advertise travel destinations based on a user profile. The program was just for the slideshow of recommendations. For this portfolio I updated the program to better serve the purpose it would be used for. For the algorithms and data structure category I selected an authentication program that I had written pseudocode for. Tin the process of creating this portfolio I used the pseudocode to create a simple version of the program. For the databases category I selected previous work done working within a database. I updated the code to auto populate tables from a file input rather than line by line from a user. Each of these artifacts shows a different aspect of programming, and how I approach my work.
